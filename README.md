# Polymorphic Malware

This demonstrates the capabilities of a basic polymorhpic malware concept. While the Proof of Concept (PoC) doesn't meet all criteria for highly complex polymorphic malware. However you may use this as a framework for your indidividual malware projects.<br>
## Compile the PoC and testing for polymorphism
Note: This code was successfully run on ARM MAC Apple Silicon hardware. Other operating systems haven't tested on.<br>
### Compiling the source code
```bash
gcc advanced.c -o poly
```
Once this binary file poly is run, it will create an "output.bin" file which stores binary data of the payload, and its data. Therefore, its appearance will put on another mask for each time it gets executed.<br>
### Testing for polymorhpism
On Mac there's a command named "xxd", this will come in handy to inspect the data's hex.
```bash
xxd output.bin
```
Run this command again on the second time you run the binary file poly to see the difference in the hex code.<br>
